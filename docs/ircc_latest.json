  "title": "Bill C-3: An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2025) comes into effect",
  "summary": "Before Bill C-3 came into effect, Canada’s Citizenship Act limited the passing on of citizenship to the first-generation for people born or adopted abroad. This meant that a Canadian citizen could only pass on citizenship to or access a direct grant of citizenship for a child born or adopted outside Canada if the parent was either born or naturalized in Canada before the child’s birth or adoption.",
